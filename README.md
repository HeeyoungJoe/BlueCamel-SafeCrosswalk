# :camel::blue_heart:BlueCamel-SafeCrosswalk

It is a long known fact people with difficulty walking fast from pregnant mothers to people with a chronic disability face pressure by the blinking lights of crosswalk traffic signals that often turn red too fast for them to get across. However, reconstructing all crosswalk environment is anticipated to take a long time. Even Seoul started the reconstruction concerning the subject just last year to fix over 10 thousand cases within Gangbook, the upper side of the city.
Blue Camel proposes SafeCrosswalk, a project that ensuress the safety of pedestrians, especially those who are either temporarily or chronically facing difficulty in moving. 


## Here's how it works üñ±Ô∏è

We aim to resolve three main criteria
* Avoid the situation where car owners are unaware of a pedestrian attempting to use a crosswalk without traffic signals
* Ensure safer crossing in case of rural areas where no crosswalk prepared
* Suggest regulations between a pedestrian and drivers at places where all traffic light is either temporarily or always replaced with flashing orange light
